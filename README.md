# daniel-speakeasy-project

This project attempts to create a database where a user can give a drink from a speakeasy a rating from 1 to 5. 1 being that the drink is a poor drink and 5 being that the drink was excellent. There will also be a comment box where the user can post, edit and delete comments accompanying the 1 - 5 rating. The rating will remain locked and stored in the database, but the users can post, edit, and delete their comments.
